        <p>
          Plastk Sentinel is a subscription-based product in the Plastk Account that helps you protect yourself against
          identity fraud by monitoring your Equifax1 for inquiries. If you select a monthly subscription, then Plastk
          will immediately charge $15.99 (plus applicable tax) to your Plastk Secure Credit Card or other payment method
          you`&apos;`ve provided and will continue to do so on a monthly basis until you cancel your Plastk Sentinel
          subscription. If you select an annual subscription, then Plastk will immediately charge $191.88.00 (plus
          applicable tax) to your Plastk Secure Credit Card or other payment method you&apos;ve provided and will
          continue to do so on an annual basis until you cancel your Plastk Sentinel Subscription. To cancel, log in to
          your Plastk Account using the Plastk Website, go to Account Settings and Click Plastk Sentinel “Unsubscribe”
          and complete the unsubscribing process. If you cancel Plastk Sentinel, you will remain subscribed until the
          end of your current monthly or annual billing cycle.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            There are no refunds or credits for partial months or years. For more clarity once the subscription has been
            activated for any length of time, no refund or credit for partial months or years is available.{' '}
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In some circumstances, Plastk may be unable to subscribe you to Plastk Sentinel due to an issue with your
          Equifax1 . In the event that Plastk is unable to subscribe you to Plastk Sentinel as a result of an issue
          caused by Equifax, you will be required to contact Equifax1 directly. If Equifax1 is unable to resolve this
          issue, then you will not receive Plastk Sentinel Service. There are no discounts or credits available if you
          are unable to use Plastk Sentinel as a result of an issue with Equifax1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once subscribed, you will get a push notification on your mobile device and/or an email (collectively, the
          “Notifications”) whenever a company makes an inquiry into your Equifax1 , which happens when your name is
          submitted to open a new account or complete an application for credit. Subject to Section 3, Plastk will
          provide Notifications within 24-48 hours of the inquiry being reported. You will not receive notifications for
          inquiries that are reported within 24-48 hours of you subscribing to Plastk Sentinel. If you notice an
          unexpected inquiry into your Equifax1 that you did not authorize, follow the steps provided in your Plastk
          Account. As your privacy and security is important to us, we have read-only access to inquiries on your
          Equifax1 and cannot view or access these inquiries.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure receipt of the Notifications, make sure that ‘Notifications’ for the Plastk App are turned to “ON”
          in your mobile device settings and your email is up-to-date in your Plastk Account settings.
        </p>
        <p>

          under the Credit Insights sections Click on Upgrade to Plastk Sentinel and follow the instructions. Plastk

          Plastk will immediately charge $15.99 (Plus applicable tax) for monthly subscriptions or $191.88 (plus
          applicable tax) for annual subscription (collectively, the “Subscription Fee”) to your Plastk Secure Credit
          Card or other payment method you’ve provided and will continue to do so on a monthly or annual basis, as the
          case may be, until you cancel your Plastk Sentinel subscription. Plastk may change the Subscription Fee from
          time to time and will communicate any Subscription Fee changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to
          accept those changes. Subscription Fee changes will take effect at the start of the next applicable billing
          cycle following the date of the Subscription Fee change. As permitted by applicable law, you accept the new
          Subscription Fee by continuing to use Plastk Sentinel after the Subscription Fee change takes effect. If you
          do not agree with the Subscription Fee change, you have the right to reject the change by cancelling your
          Plastk Sentinel subscription prior to the Subscription Fee change going into effect. Please, therefore, make
          sure you read any such notification of a Subscription Fee change carefully.

        <p>
          Plastk Sentinel is offered pursuant to a subscription that automatically renews on a monthly or annual basis
          (as the case may be) indefinitely without further action by you, and the applicable Subscription Fee is
          charged to your provided payment method on the same day of each subsequent monthly or annual renewal term. So
          long as the Plastk Sentinel subscription remains active, you will be entitled to all of the features,
          benefits, and privileges associated with Plastk Sentinel until the subscription is cancelled by you or
          otherwise terminates or expires. In the event Plastk is unable to process a payment for your monthly or annual
          Plastk Sentinel Services from the payment method you’ve provided, your account will remain active for 90 days,
          however your account will not be updated for any unpaid portion of your subscription. Plastk will within that
          90-day period, continue to try to debit your selected payment method option, if unsuccessful within the 90-day
          period, your Plastk Sentinel Services will be terminated, however you will still be liable for any outstanding
          balances.{' '}
